## General Rules

- Respect and maturity are essential. No discrimination, racism, sexism, or hate speech tolerated. We embrace diversity and require English for inclusive communication.

- New recruits must join our [Discord](https://discord.clashwithjpa.com/) and share an approved FWA base with a leader, co-leader, or elder. Ensure a clean CC profile before becoming a clan member.

- Be active, polite, and mature; respect others.

- Join a league promptly when the season begins; don't delay.

- Donation request must be filled prior to your new request (please try to do it). If you see a donation request, please donate instead of thinking or waiting for someone else to donate!

- Clan mails :envelope: are very important! Please be sure to **read them** and feel free to ask any questions if you have any doubts.

- Must opt in yourself **24/7** in war, as we do 50 vs 50 wars regularly.

- We don't have any ratios but you will be warned if you are found leeching troops, try to accept troops of all levels if you’re comfortable since we're a clan which is level 10+, so naturally all troops donated are upgraded by 2 levels and you will be receiving decent level of troops.

- If you make an any/unspecific request, don’t complain if you are given what you didn’t want. To prevent this from happening, be specific with what you want and/or don’t want in your request.

- You are allowed to request for "max troops" but do not worry if it takes time as requesting max makes it less seen to the ones who don't have max troops even after donation upgrade.

- Respect request and only donate what is requested. If you mess up your donation, admit it and apologize instead of stretching up the things; nothing bad in it.

## War Rules

- We always do 50 vs 50 FWA wars only.
- Clan Mail must be read (and also double check) prior to war attacks to check the current war strategy.
- Make sure you use both your attacks in every war. Always attack your mirror on your first attack with 2 or 3 stars :star: depending on instructions.
    > <span style="color: lightblue;">If you attack late in war and your mirror has been attacked as part of cleanup then your 1st attack should still be your mirror and then proceed with either 1 star attack for loot or cleanup if available</span>
- Failure to Follow the current war strategy and war rules may result in warning or might be :sandal: from the clan, depending upon how deep the offense is or you may get <span style="color: red; font-style: bold;">flagged</span> from FWA.

- <span style="color: red;">NEVER EVER donate to any defensive war clan castles (provided it is an FWA war).</span>

## War Strategy

The war strategy for current war will always be posted in a clan mail :envelope: before battle day commences/starts. Please read it and feel free to ask any questions before attacking if you're unsure what to do .

:trophy: There are basically 4 war types:

- 🗡 FWA win war
- 🗡 FWA lose war
- 🗡 Normal mismatches
- 🗡 Blacklisted matches

### FWA Wars

Always check your position on the war map (which base number) to identify your mirror base before you attack or you may be warned or would be forced to find a new home.

Always attack your mirror base based with the current war strategy. Failure to attack your mirror base correctly will result in a warning.

All war attacks must be completed in the first 12 hours :clock12:

#### FWA Win War

In a FWA win war everyone must 3 star :star: their mirror on their first attack and then on the second attack go for 2 star on any top bases for loot. If you want war stars, feel free to wait for the clean-up time :hourglass_flowing_sand: and 3 star any base.

Stars per attack:

- :house: 1st attack - 3 star :star: on your mirror
- :house: 2nd attack - 2 star :star: on any top base for loot
- :house: Once clean-up time starts, feel free to 3 star :star: any base for war stars.

Note :pencil::

- If your mirror is a TH11 and above, you'll need to take out the Eagle Artillery before you release all your troops (as it will get activated).
- Dropping your Heroes on the town hall first will help you get a star right away in case you lose connection.
- Loons alone cannot take out the AQ section. You'll need rage, heroes to clear the section.

#### FWA Lose War

Attack your mirror base for 2 stars :star: or any free marked bases and second attack loot any top base (only for 1 star) or you can also wait for last 12 hours (clean-up time :hourglass_flowing_sand:) to 2 star :star: any base for war stars.

Stars per attack:

- :house: 1st attack - 2 star :star: on your mirror
- :house: 2nd attack - 1 star :star: on any top base for loot
- :house: Once clean-up time starts, feel free to 2 star :star: any base for war stars.

Note :pencil::

- Sometimes due to mistakes by other members (like 3 starring a base), you will be notified to not attack incase the goal of 100 stars is already achieved.

### Non FWA Wars

Sometimes we get mismatches or blacklisted matches. In such cases, you will be notified in the clan mail about the strategy to follow.

#### Normal Mismatches

In a normal mismatch war; Leader or a Co-Leader will negotiate with the war opponent to leave the town halls and storages outside and unprotected. You may attack any base for any number of stars and/or loot. If we fail to do so, you may have some :beers: :tropical_drink: :cookie: till the war ends.

:warning: <span style="color: red;">We never change to war base</span> :warning:

Non FWA clans will be invited to send a representative to visit and check out our war log so that they can be confident that we are sincere. Please treat these visitors with courtesy.

#### Blacklisted Matches

We would love to take fight in this war, we swap all our bases to strong war bases :house:. Leader or Co-Leaders will post mail :envelope: (regarding war strategy) as soon as possible. Strategies and everything will be conveyed through Discord‼️

## Strike System

Clan members are given 4 strikes before they are kicked. You are allowed to re-apply again if you are interested in joining back.

> <span>You strikes are lowered by 1 at the end of every 4 weeks and reset to 0 at the end of every two seasons, i.e, Feb,April, June, August, October, December</span>

Some members will be allowed a higher "strike value" based on loyalty to the clan. Leaders have the right to overrule the strike system and act as they think is more appropriate.

> <span>Please also note that we only use strikes as a reference point to gauge inactivity. Leaders reserve the right to remove any member if they are deemed to be doing the minimum continuously. If the member is not being a team player or if they’re the most inactive out of their respective townhall and is affecting FWA matchmaking.</span>

We give different amount of strikes based on the reason for the strike. Here are the reasons and the amount of strikes given:

- ### 0.5 Strike

    - Not attacking mirror with your first attack in war
    - Breaking any of the general rules

- ### 1 Strike

    - Not meeting the seasonal requirements
    - Missing both war attacks; exceptions can be made when notified within 24 hours of war end or well in advance to the leader/co-leader.
    - Not replying when called up in discord by a co-leader or leader
    - Not following the war plan sent in game.
    - 1 or 2 starring your mirror in a win war
    - Looting top bases without hitting your mirror even though it is already 3 starred.

- ### 2 Strikes

    - Not having your FWA base up during FWA wars.
    - 3 starring a base in loose war
    - Attacking someone's mirror before clean-up time.
    - Having a FWA base during a blacklisted match.
    - Leaving the clan without asking permission.

## Clan Raid

Clan raid is optional but if you opt in, make sure you follow the rules mentioned below.

Every member must use their 6 attacks (including the bonus attack). You will not get strikes just because you are bad (but we also highly appreciate to gain most of the capital gold). Donate your capital gold to what is asked in discord/clan mails. Ask in discord first (if in doubt).

Some key rules to follow:

- Finish current base :house: before moving
- Check before attacking a partially finished base, wait for 5 minutes so you can take over someone.
- If an attack is not working as expected, don't keep using it.
- The more you perform the more raid medals you guys will receive :incoming_envelope:.

## Clan War League

CWL is optional but if you opt in, make sure you follow the rules mentioned below. The CWL clan is decided based on your account _weight_.

- We will be doing CWL and regular FWA wars at the same time so you need to keep your FWA war base active **AT ALL TIMES** – If you got a **WAR BASE** in FWA that is an instant kick or warning.
- Do not stay in the CWL clan unnecessarily. Hop over to attack and return to your main clan immediately after your CWL attack.
- Follow the war plan instructions in your assigned CWL room on Discord/Band, do not overstep.
- Be prepared before leaving. Make sure you have clan castle troops, your full army trained and heroes healed, before going.
- Do Not Leave main clan outside of active fwa war. FWA sync might be approaching anytime.
- Turn your invites on, so we can send you invites when you jump out from the main clan.
- Bookmark your CWL clan so you do not get lost.
- Tag a Leader/Co-Leader/Elder in your clan specific chat if you cannot request into the clan. This means when you request, the request sent message does not show up. This happens because there can be only 5 sitting requests at any one time, so you might be the 6th one😉.

**Rest all about CWL is detailed in our Discord server [here](https://discord.com/channels/1029993902503108678/1040227707528683570)**
