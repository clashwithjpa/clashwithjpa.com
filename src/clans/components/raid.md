## Clan Raid

Clan raid is optional but if you opt in, make sure you follow the rules mentioned below.

Every member must use their 6 attacks (including the bonus attack). You will not get strikes just because you are bad (but we also highly appreciate to gain most of the capital gold). Donate your capital gold to what is asked in discord/clan mails. Ask in discord first (if in doubt).

Some key rules to follow:

- Finish current base :house: before moving
- Check before attacking a partially finished base, wait for 5 minutes so you can take over someone.
- If an attack is not working as expected, don't keep using it.
- The more you perform the more raid medals you guys will receive :incoming_envelope:.
