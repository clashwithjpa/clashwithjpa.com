## War Rules

- We always do 50 vs 50 FWA wars only.
- Clan Mail must be read (and also double check) prior to war attacks to check the current war strategy.
- Make sure you use both your attacks in every war. Always attack your mirror on your first attack with 2 or 3 stars :star: depending on instructions.
    > <span style="color: lightblue;">If you attack late in war and your mirror has been attacked as part of cleanup then your 1st attack should still be your mirror and then proceed with either 1 star attack for loot or cleanup if available</span>
- Failure to Follow the current war strategy and war rules may result in warning or might be :sandal: from the clan, depending upon how deep the offense is or you may get <span style="color: red; font-style: bold;">flagged</span> from FWA.

- <span style="color: red;">NEVER EVER donate to any defensive war clan castles (provided it is an FWA war).</span>
