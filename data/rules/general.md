## General Rules

- Respect and maturity are essential. No discrimination, racism, sexism, or hate speech tolerated. We embrace diversity and require English for inclusive communication.

- New recruits must join our [Discord](https://discord.clashwithjpa.com/) and share an approved FWA base with a leader, co-leader, or elder. Ensure a clean CC profile before becoming a clan member.

- Be active, polite, and mature; respect others.

- Join a league promptly when the season begins; don't delay.

- Donation request must be filled prior to your new request (please try to do it). If you see a donation request, please donate instead of thinking or waiting for someone else to donate!

- Clan mails :envelope: are very important! Please be sure to **read them** and feel free to ask any questions if you have any doubts.

- Must opt in yourself **24/7** in war, as we do 50 vs 50 wars regularly.

- We don't have any ratios but you will be warned if you are found leeching troops, try to accept troops of all levels if you’re comfortable since we're a clan which is level 10+, so naturally all troops donated are upgraded by 2 levels and you will be receiving decent level of troops.

- If you make an any/unspecific request, don’t complain if you are given what you didn’t want. To prevent this from happening, be specific with what you want and/or don’t want in your request.

- You are allowed to request for "max troops" but do not worry if it takes time as requesting max makes it less seen to the ones who don't have max troops even after donation upgrade.

- Respect request and only donate what is requested. If you mess up your donation, admit it and apologize instead of stretching up the things; nothing bad in it.
