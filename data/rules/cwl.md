## Clan War League

CWL is optional but if you opt in, make sure you follow the rules mentioned below. The CWL clan is decided based on your account _weight_.

- We will be doing CWL and regular FWA wars at the same time so you need to keep your FWA war base active **AT ALL TIMES** â€“ If you got a **WAR BASE** in FWA that is an instant kick or warning.
- Do not stay in the CWL clan unnecessarily. Hop over to attack and return to your main clan immediately after your CWL attack.
- Follow the war plan instructions in your assigned CWL room on Discord/Band, do not overstep.
- Be prepared before leaving. Make sure you have clan castle troops, your full army trained and heroes healed, before going.
- Do Not Leave main clan outside of active fwa war. FWA sync might be approaching anytime.
- Turn your invites on, so we can send you invites when you jump out from the main clan.
- Bookmark your CWL clan so you do not get lost.
- Tag a Leader/Co-Leader/Elder in your clan specific chat if you cannot request into the clan. This means when you request, the request sent message does not show up. This happens because there can be only 5 sitting requests at any one time, so you might be the 6th oneðŸ˜‰.

**Rest all about CWL is detailed in our Discord server [here](https://discord.com/channels/1029993902503108678/1040227707528683570)**
