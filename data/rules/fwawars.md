## War Strategy

The war strategy for current war will always be posted in a clan mail :envelope: before battle day commences/starts. Please read it and feel free to ask any questions before attacking if you're unsure what to do .

:trophy: There are basically 4 war types:

- üó° FWA win war
- üó° FWA lose war
- üó° Normal mismatches
- üó° Blacklisted matches

### FWA Wars

Always check your position on the war map (which base number) to identify your mirror base before you attack or you may be warned or would be forced to find a new home.

Always attack your mirror base based with the current war strategy. Failure to attack your mirror base correctly will result in a warning.

All war attacks must be completed in the first 12 hours :clock12:

#### FWA Win War

In a FWA win war everyone must 3 star :star: their mirror on their first attack and then on the second attack go for 2 star on any top bases for loot. If you want war stars, feel free to wait for the clean-up time :hourglass_flowing_sand: and 3 star any base.

Stars per attack:

- :house: 1st attack - 3 star :star: on your mirror
- :house: 2nd attack - 2 star :star: on any top base for loot
- :house: Once clean-up time starts, feel free to 3 star :star: any base for war stars.

Note :pencil::

- If your mirror is a TH11 and above, you'll need to take out the Eagle Artillery before you release all your troops (as it will get activated).
- Dropping your Heroes on the town hall first will help you get a star right away in case you lose connection.
- Loons alone cannot take out the AQ section. You'll need rage, heroes to clear the section.

#### FWA Lose War

Attack your mirror base for 2 stars :star: or any free marked bases and second attack loot any top base (only for 1 star) or you can also wait for last 12 hours (clean-up time :hourglass_flowing_sand:) to 2 star :star: any base for war stars.

Stars per attack:

- :house: 1st attack - 2 star :star: on your mirror
- :house: 2nd attack - 1 star :star: on any top base for loot
- :house: Once clean-up time starts, feel free to 2 star :star: any base for war stars.

Note :pencil::

- Sometimes due to mistakes by other members (like 3 starring a base), you will be notified to not attack incase the goal of 100 stars is already achieved.

### Non FWA Wars

Sometimes we get mismatches or blacklisted matches. In such cases, you will be notified in the clan mail about the strategy to follow.

#### Normal Mismatches

In a normal mismatch war; Leader or a Co-Leader will negotiate with the war opponent to leave the town halls and storages outside and unprotected. You may attack any base for any number of stars and/or loot. If we fail to do so, you may have some :beers: :tropical_drink: :cookie: till the war ends.

:warning: <span style="color: red;">We never change to war base</span> :warning:

Non FWA clans will be invited to send a representative to visit and check out our war log so that they can be confident that we are sincere. Please treat these visitors with courtesy.

#### Blacklisted Matches

We would love to take fight in this war, we swap all our bases to strong war bases :house:. Leader or Co-Leaders will post mail :envelope: (regarding war strategy) as soon as possible. Strategies and everything will be conveyed through Discord‚ÄºÔ∏è
