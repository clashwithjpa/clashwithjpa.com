## Strike System

Clan members are given 4 strikes before they are kicked. You are allowed to re-apply again if you are interested in joining back.

> <span>You strikes are lowered by 1 at the end of every 4 weeks and reset to 0 at the end of every two seasons, i.e, Feb,April, June, August, October, December</span>

Some members will be allowed a higher "strike value" based on loyalty to the clan. Leaders have the right to overrule the strike system and act as they think is more appropriate.

> <span>Please also note that we only use strikes as a reference point to gauge inactivity. Leaders reserve the right to remove any member if they are deemed to be doing the minimum continuously. If the member is not being a team player or if theyâ€™re the most inactive out of their respective townhall and is affecting FWA matchmaking.</span>
